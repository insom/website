[My wife][1] is an ex-web-developer. She knows HTML and CSS and spent several years on the front lines of keeping customer sites up-to-date and looking well, by hand editing HTML files and with custom written CMSes.

Last night I was explaining to her how making websites work at different screen resolutions had recently been &#8220;cutting edge&#8221; web development.

We used to [make sites that responded to the viewport][2] in the early 2000&#8217;s &#8211; before delivering a site as a PSD or a set of JPEGs became the norm. <sup id="fnref-181-1"><a href="#fn-181-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

We pushed back strongly when people, who were generally coming from print, sent us pixel perfect designs with areas &#8220;above the fold&#8221; and typography that wouldn&#8217;t work on the web unless it was saved out as images. I think that, as an industry, early web developers lost this battle to designers and that we failed to educate customers. I think that the whole web has suffered for it for over a decade.

It was embarrassing explaining to someone who counts as a &#8220;knowledgeable outsider&#8221; how long we&#8217;ve all taken to get our shit together.

<li id="fn-181-1">
  I realise this site isn&#8217;t going to win any design awards. We worked on pretty things, too, but function was always first.&#160;<a href="#fnref-181-1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
