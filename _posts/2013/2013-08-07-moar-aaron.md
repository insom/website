My short post on [Responsive Designs vs. Traditional Builds][1] is up on $WORK&rsquo;s blog. While I&rsquo;m not a designer, playing with this stuff has been fun. Responsive web design makes CSS almost programmerish by adding what is essentially a `if` statement to the language.

You can [follow me][2] (and this blog, which auto-posts using [Pour-Over][3]) on pay-to-play microblogging site [App.net][4]. If you [use this link to create an account][5], you&rsquo;ll automatically follow me and I&rsquo;ll get a small amount of extra space on the service.

(I also worked on a screenshot-tastic post for iWeb FTP for people [getting started with the service][6] that probably isn&rsquo;t of too much interest to this audience, but consider it linked-to.)

I&rsquo;ve got a new [bottom bracket][8] waiting for me at home. My old one, well, it&rsquo;s a little rusty.

_And_ I dumped quite a lot of time into getting quieter cooling on my ProLiant ML115 G5. I use this server-grade hardware as a gaming PC, and I&rsquo;m kind of picky about noise.

I replaced the stock 92mm with this [Arctic Cooling F9 PWM controlled one][10] (amazon affiliate link) because there&rsquo;s a four-pin header on the board. Unfortunately, as part of the [POST process][11] process the HP decides to slow the fan down, and then immediately panics about the RPMs going below 1900. Once it does that, it powers off.

I spent some time playing with it and even resolved to use a small microcontroller to &ldquo;fake&rdquo; 1900RPM to the sense pin, but in the end just leaving the fourth pin disconnected (pictured) keeps the fan spinning fast enough and it&rsquo;s quieter than the stock fan even when it stays at 100% all of the time. I butchered the old fan&rsquo;s cable to do this and then used heat-shrink to make everything look un-butchered.

I may revisit this, for kicks. I even got to [break out my oscilloscope][12] while trying to get everything to work.
