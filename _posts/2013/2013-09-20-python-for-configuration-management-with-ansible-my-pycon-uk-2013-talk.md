There&rsquo;s also a [GitHub repository][1] with the code featured in the talk and some extra scaffolding which wasn&rsquo;t included (like models for the web application).

(For the person who asked, the font selection I used was:

<div class="codehilite">
  <pre><span class="n">Consolas</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Ubuntu Mono"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">monospace</span>
</pre>
</div>

The slides were rendered to PDF from HTML on a Debian machine)
