Call it [shilling][1] if you want, but I&rsquo;m always proud when `$WORK` does something for the general good (which, in fairness it does quite a bit of, and then forgets to tell people, like helping to [sponsor the Mad Natters][2] and donating the proceeds of selling our redundant IT kit).

This time around, it&rsquo;s very close to what I do: our file sharing service, iWeb Storage is [giving away accounts to registered UK charities][3].

![Thank You for Your Support][4]

I&rsquo;ve dealt with several charities over the years who use our service (and some really cool organisations who _do_ pay for it), they&rsquo;re among our happiest customers because a lot of them are neccessarily distributed and our whole service is designed around helping distributed groups collaborate.

Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to follow this up with a great up-take rate, but it&rsquo;s very early days now. If you&rsquo;re reading this and you do charitable work, please please give the [service a try][5] or [contact them][6].
