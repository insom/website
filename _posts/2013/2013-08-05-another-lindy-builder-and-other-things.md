[Bas Mostert][1] has been building his own low-power board into a Lindy enclosure! His is a 700Mhz Geode which, crucially, has two NICs and should be able to max out his home Internet connection (something that the Raspberry Pi can&rsquo;t do, certainly not with a USB NIC in the mix).

![Look at that power connector!][2]

![Like it was made for it][3]

He also still has his door, so won&rsquo;t need to fashion a front for it [out of mesh][4]. I&rsquo;ve actually retired mine, which wasn&rsquo;t an entirely popular decision, because I want to run [Plex Media Server][5]. This is closed source and currently only available for Intel-based platforms, so the Pi never even had a chance.

That said, I&rsquo;m still saving power (kind of), because I&rsquo;m using an HP MicroServer as the new under-the-stairs computer, which has a pretty low power Neo processor, and Plex is being frontend by a cheap and _very_ low power [Roku LT][6] box. My previous DLNA client was an Xbox 360, which is a beast for electricity usage.

(You can tell I&rsquo;m still convincing myself, right?)
