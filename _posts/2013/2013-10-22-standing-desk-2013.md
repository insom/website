Standing desks are a recurring topic at [iWeb][1]. Every time [it comes up][2] [on BBC News][3], or there&rsquo;s a novel kickstarter, or just because someone (often me) rearranges their desk, we lose another half an hour to Googling for solutions: [make shift][4], [custom built][5] or [bought][6].

I think I&rsquo;ve finally come up with $0 and stable solution (I used to just use six of these blue filing boxes, that was a bit rickety):

Bill of Materials:

  * 2 x [HP ML115G5 Servers][8]
  * 1 x [Dell PowerEdge R300][9]
  * 2 x Blue Viking Direct Filing Boxes

This not only helps my posture, I&rsquo;m recycling equipment that we can&rsquo;t easily dispose of. Thanks [WEEE][10]!
