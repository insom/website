> If you are a sysadmin, you&rsquo;ll no doubt be heartedly sick of that power. You&rsquo;ve been handed huge amounts of power, and responsibility &mdash; and nobody else but you seems to care. 
> 
> There&rsquo;s a good reason why sysadmins and doctors share the same morbid, callous sense of humour &mdash; both groups find themselves dealing with more responsibility towards others than you can reasonably expect a sane human to take. (At least doctors can expect their customers to understand what they might be palming off to another person.

> Sysadmins have to live with the equivalent in medical terms of somebody leaving a naked body on the doorstep at 9AM, with a Post-IT note attached to it saying &ldquo;**Had sex with twenty people last night and now I think the kidney isn&rsquo;t working.** Could you get this back to me with my IQ intact for my 10AM appointment?&rdquo;)
