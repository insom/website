Whooee. It's been a while. I'm sorry, I've been a bad blogger. I've wanted
to write here, but I've had way, and I mean *way*, too much to do.
I'm working at [a new place][aaron], where I am full-time employed to not write
Python.  I'm working with that other &ldquo;P&rdquo; language, the one without
any vowels in the name. Yes, *that* one.

I'll hopefully, sometime, eventually have some code to show, which I embarked
upon *just* before going to Interactive. It's a new Python
interface to [Why The Lucky Stiff][why]'s [YAML parser][syck], with
[Tim Parkin][tp] & [Matt Goodall][mg] of [Pollenation Internet][pollenation].

I've held off mentioning it, but the added pressure of public announcement
might make me f*cking finish it. I'm experimenting with shame as a motivating
factor, here.

Finally, to the good bit. I recently retro-fitted a Blueberry iMac into
a PC Case. Space constraints, and the quality of the monitor, meant it was
going to have to shape-up or ship-out. 

Because the machine is actually worth almost nothing to sell, but I like it a
lot, I took out the ol' soldering iron, and shoe-horned it into a case of a
P166 Siemens (which was free).

One ATX cable spliced into a Mac power cable, one bluetooth adaptor, and
one Mac<->VGA adaptor later (I had the last two around), and I have an
ATX form-factor iMac, photographed in its kitchen-counter glory below:
