Like it? It's my new retro-nym, it stands for "Rails Apache MySQL POSIX".

I know, I know, Rails has generated a lot of buzz, too much in many
people's eyes. It certainly is not the be-all and end-all of web
frameworks, but it's *cool*.

I spent Saturday reading the [PickAxe][1] book and [why's Poignant Guide][2].
Today I felt ready. I braved the [Debian install of Ruby][3], and set about
developing my first Rails app.

For the Pythonistas out there, the best way to describe it would be
[Quixote][4] meets [PSP][5] meets [SQLObject][6]. I've used Quixote and
SQLObject (with [CheetahTemplate][7]) to build a hotel management system, and
it *is* extremely smooth, but because they are disparate parts, they don't
integrate as well as they could. Re-examining my previous code, I could have
cut the development time literally in half.

It's not that they have bad integration, in fact at the time I thought
the integration was great. It's just that having seen how ActiveRecord
is such an integral part of Rails, you start to realise how much
further that integration could go. I think this is what [Subway][8] is
aiming for.

I'm developing a personal project in Rails to learn the ropes, get in the
swing, and generally monkey around. After that, barring any overwhelming
reason not to, I'll be developing my company's new product in it.

So, to the point: I'm here to advocate that any computer polyglots out
there realise that *sometimes* it's worth learning a new language (or
revisiting an old one) to get at its tools. Rails definately applies here,
and I think [Seaside2][9] does too.
