title: Using Vim with Dreamweaver Templates

Wow, I went to create a new folder for a new month, and the last one was 05,
with just one entry in it.

Anyway, a quick one: Here's a [Vim syntax hilighting file][1] for use editing
files that use Dreamweaver templates. It just puts template areas in grey, just
like Dreamweaver does, and it uses the PHP + HTML formatting mode for the
editable regions.

You can ":source" the file after opening your target file, or you can add your
own autoloads such as:

```vim
	:au BufNewFile,BufRead *.php so <sfile>:h/dwt.vim
```
