> Gabriel finally decided that he&rsquo;d had enough of his perfectly normal body and wanted to kick things up, which meant supplements, specifically a huge tub of some granulated masculizer ostensibly flavored like Chocolate, but with a backbone of ready-mix concrete serrated by a distinctive quartz tang.
