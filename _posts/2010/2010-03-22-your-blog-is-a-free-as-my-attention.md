The problem with the sentiment expressed above, [in my opinion, I mean, and I&rsquo;m probably totally wrong][2] (herein; IMOIMAIPTW), is that is makes it sound like Smashing Magazine was a charity which is on a pledge drive, and that it had nothing to gain from its relentless self-promotion.

I would like to say I _fully_ believe they have the right to pull their content, replace it with a page asking you to buy their book, even put it back online behind a pay-wall, whatever; it&rsquo;s their content. _And_ I understand that the words above aren&rsquo;t from a representative (though they are retweeted by Smashing).

That said, we-the-public have contributed to the community, retweeted posts, emailed them to friends, [bought the book][3] and championed them in our workplaces.

This promotion is as good as an exchange of services in my mind (IMOIMAIPTW): they provide &lsquo;free&rsquo; content, readers provide &lsquo;free&rsquo; promotion (and quality paid promotion is very expensive _indeed_), a segment of the readership like it so much that they buy services off the back of it, and advertisers pay them when free-loaders view the site.

Other established &lsquo;free&rsquo; resources (blogs, howtos, royalty-free creative work) benefit from publicity, consulting side gigs, and improved chances of further or better employment. Even if you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;in it for the money&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s rewarding to have people consume the things that you&rsquo;ve produced.

Obviously, there&rsquo;s something wrong in the balance, because from the look of their posts Smashing are having a little trouble making all the ends meet up, and they&rsquo;re trying to push revenue which is _totally fine_; but no one should undermine the important role that readers actually play.

Free magazines without a readership rarely last long.
