[That&rsquo;s three hours of my life I&rsquo;m not getting back][1]

They should make students studying history play Civilisation; I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t object, especially if it&rsquo;s for their passing grade.

There&rsquo;s nothing like the final stages of a domination victory, when you&rsquo;re pumping out catapults and conquistadors like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow, when you&rsquo;re researching technology that will take so long to learn you will have completed the game, when units you built on the other side of the map won&rsquo;t make it to the battle before it&rsquo;s won, to make you realise that [Eisenhower was right][2] &#8211; the military industrial complex is a force to be reckoned with.

If the game didn&rsquo;t just end instantly when I&rsquo;d won, I&rsquo;d be left several dozen units to &hellip; find a purpose for and a dozen factories midway through building more units. Would you throw that progress away to go build settlers? You&rsquo;re already committed, you may as well see them through. And all that military research too, switching now would be hubris.

You end up with a lot of hardware, a lot of knowledge, and a lot of production capacity, looking for the next war.
