[Oliver Hulland][2] visits the NSA&rsquo;s cryptologic museum:

> The highlight of the museum is the functional Enigma: an electro-mechanical rotor machine used for the encryption and decryption of messages by the Germans in World War II.

When I was 14 I saw an enigma machine at the [Orangerie in Kassel, Germany][3] &#8211; it&rsquo;s one of two times when I really felt a dizzying sense of my place in history. (The other was seeing the [Clock of the Long Now][4] at the Science Museum, London).

The technology exhibit was visiting the Orangerie from the [Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel][5] and wasn&rsquo;t specifically related to computing, though that was the part I was most interested in. Amongst other things it featured 2Kbit of core memory, a Commodore PET and the (non-operational) three-rotor Enigma (marking it as army or air-force, not Wehrmacht). I just stared at it.

The Colossus may be considered the start of modern computing, but the Enigma was the reason Turing designed it.
