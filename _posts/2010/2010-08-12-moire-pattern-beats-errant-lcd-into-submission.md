[Helen][2] has an [Acer AL1916W][3] monitor. It&rsquo;s widescreen, it&rsquo;s nice and it mostly gets used with my Xbox (for which it&rsquo;s fine). However, it&rsquo;s -always- been slightly blurry when used with her Mac mini. This is made even worse (for me, I don&rsquo;t think that she notices) by the fact that the blurriness is not uniform &mdash; the middle of the screen appears way sharper than the edges, giving it a 1950&rsquo;s CRT vibe.

The &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; button didn&rsquo;t fix things&mdash; I&rsquo;d see a few moments of clarity before it decided that blurry was, after all, what I had wanted. The plainer the screen was, the blurrier &ldquo;auto&rdquo; defaulted to. I decided to give the screen the most difficult thing to display I could, the moire pattern above.

Displaying it without adjustment caused it to visibly phase in and out, pretty in a way. Finally, pressing &ldquo;auto&rdquo; has left me with headache free text. I&rsquo;m pretty sure H won&rsquo;t notice.
