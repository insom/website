Three blips of activity of my Github:

  * I&rsquo;ve made [bmtu][1] output the actual Twitter API error message, if it&rsquo;s returned in the JSON.
  * I&rsquo;ve created a new repository for my old [48K Spectrum build environment][2]. I&rsquo;m tempted to dust this off and play a bit more with it over the break, maybe even on my real 48K.
  * I&rsquo;ve scanned the dregs of my old blog and have created a gist for the only hack I felt worth saving: [Griffin Powermate to ALSA MIDI][3] &#8211; an example C program to map a Linux input device to MIDI events. This, also, stands to be cleaned up as technically it supports just about any &ldquo;analogue style&rdquo; Linux input device, including Xbox controllers.
