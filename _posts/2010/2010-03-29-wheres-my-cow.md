This is the first book that I read to Dylan, back before he was even interested in flicking through picture books; &ldquo;[Where&rsquo;s my Cow?][2]&ldquo;. In the story, Sam Vimes makes a point of getting home from work every day in time to read his son the same story, called &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Cow?&rdquo;.

We read this book together every day for nearly a year, Dylan got to the point where he could recite the pages from memory, with the voices, giving a damn good impression of reading. He&rsquo;d point at Young Sam, and say it was him, and at Vimes &#8211; a gritty middle-aged man losing his hair (!) &#8211; and say it was me.

Over the last couple of years his collection of books has expanded, he likes to have Dr. Seuss read to him, and read his &ldquo;Postman Pat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Charlie and Lola&rdquo; books. He asks for us to read &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Cow?&rdquo; less and less.

The last time we read it, he was surprised that Vimes didn&rsquo;t really look like me. This time, he was confused because he doesn&rsquo;t have _any_ of the toys in the room in the story &#8211; so how could it be about him? He reads the author on the inside page and, even though he can spell his and my names, reads them out as &ldquo;Dylan and Aaron&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a major lump of credulity left over from being two.

Sadly, I don&rsquo;t think there are many readings of this book left before he truly realises it&rsquo;s a book by someone else, about other people. I think we&rsquo;ll read it sparingly.
