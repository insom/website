Standing Jerker Desk (via [zomBdog][2])

(This is someone else&rsquo;s desk)

This picture was the start of a two day obsession that shows no sign of abating.

I&rsquo;ve flirted with the idea of a standing desk for over a year. I&rsquo;m frequently uncomfortable while I type and this combined with short sightedness, and a recommendation from my optician to wear my glasses less, means I end up hunching over the keyboard.

This particular desk isn&rsquo;t made any more, and it&rsquo;s been replaced with [Fredrik][3] &#8211; a narrower but still quite expensive option. I love the full adaptability of this, but it looks fugly.

[Galant][4] desks are cheaper and can go up to 1m tall, but I&rsquo;m still not sure that&rsquo;s tall enough.

Really though, I have a restored pine desk that, while hardly antique, is a nice piece and I&rsquo;ve put a bit of effort into it already. I like a big work surface, so ideally I&rsquo;d have something that can go on top, without taking over the whole desk.

Lindy, purveyors of things that make one thing able to plug into another thing, have just added a [retort-stand style clamp system][5]:

This looks good, but as all the parts are priced separately, and I&rsquo;m not even completely confident that I want this, it seems spendy.

I saw [this article][8] on SimplifiedBuilding.com, where a guy uses Kee Klamp to make a standing desk. It looks a little flimsy, but it also looks cheap, and appeals to the physical hacker in me.

Of course, Kee Klamp is an American product, not exactly stocked by our local B&Q, but there&rsquo;s [places online][9] that do it surprisingly cheap, around &pound;4 per clamp (plus the not-exactly cheap tubing).

I&rsquo;m still keeping an eye on these, if I&rsquo;m still interested in a week or two&rsquo;s time then I&rsquo;ll build a parts list.
