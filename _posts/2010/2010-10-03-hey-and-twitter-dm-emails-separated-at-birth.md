[c-hey][1] and Twitter DM emails: separated at birth?

It&rsquo;s nice to see people paying attention to the text version of their multipart/alternative emails. I&rsquo;ve tried a great deal of IMAP clients, but I still keep coming back to [PINE][2]<sup>1</sup>, the first client I ever used.

Most text/plain parts of emails are:

  * Blank.
  
    Heads up: if you just send text/html, plain text clients can at least _try_ and render something useful.
  * _Very_ badly converted HTML-to-text versions of the HTML.
  
    Again, most plain text clients can do a better job.
  * Links to an HTML version of the email.
  
    That&rsquo;s okay, I guess, but I&rsquo;d rather have the content.

<sup>1</sup> And now with [Alpine][3], it&rsquo;s available under a useful license. &ldquo;;tfcron^Madxy&rdquo; is short for deleting all emails from &ldquo;Cron&rdquo; and expunging the current folder. This is where the power is. Alpine is the vi of mail clients.
