I&rsquo;ve finished my first couple of essays from [Cory Doctorow][1]&lsquo;s &ldquo;[CONTENT][2]&ldquo;; I fancied a little bit of a break so I read [Anda&rsquo;s Game][3] in one sitting. All this reading is due to my purchase of a [Sony eReader][4] on a (little bit of a) whim at the end of last year.

[<img src="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4353048269_d77c655500.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="My eReader, Stuffed with Free Media" />][5]

I found myself &pound;150 poorer for the purchase, and not immediately willing to shell out more on E-books [(grammatical reasoning behind this spelling)][6] on top of this &mdash; I do understand the value of the written word, believe me, I buy a lot of books, but Christmas happened and I had enough dead-tree-format books that I couldn&rsquo;t really justify the purchase of 1-and-0 books.

One of the things that Cory discusses is that a struggling writer&rsquo;s problem is almost never that someone is stealing your work; it&rsquo;s that people aren&rsquo;t reading it at all.

I&rsquo;d heard of Cory Doctorow via his activism for the [EFF][7]; I read [Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom][8] a few years ago, as a PDF. I had a recommendation to listen to his podcast, and so I ended up having [Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town][9] read &lsquo;to me&rsquo; over the course of a few dozen trips to and from work (as well as flights to and from Ireland).

His self-promotion book-ending the podcast got me to go and hunt down a physical copy of [Little Brother][10], no mean feat for a multi-award-winning book &#8211; it was very scarce on the ground at airport, ferry or Dublin bookshops; had I an E-book reader at that point I probably would not have bothered, I would have just downloaded it (which sadly, would have cost him his royalties).

So, back to the recent past. I had a reader, and nothing to read. I put a few PDFs on there of technical material, and some _gasp_ pirated SF (which, being god-damned right again, Mr. Doctorow points out is the only written word people seem to care enough about to steal).

None of these were optimised for electronic editions &#8211; the PDFs were basically what got sent to the printers, without the crop marks and calibration marks. I was beginning to regret my purchase.

Around the same time, [Merlin Mann recommended Stanza][11] as a must-have application for the iPhone. It links into [Project Gutenberg][12], [Feedbooks][13] and other free listings, as well as commercial suppliers. After downloading a few of the classics (pretence is hard, I will not be reading Dante&rsquo;s Inferno in the original translation), the other major supply of free content was Cory Doctorow books and 60&rsquo;s-era Sci-Fi authors. Long story short, my iPhone is now filled with Harry Harrison and Cory Doctorow books.

Reading off an iPhone is unpleasant &#8211; it&rsquo;ll do in a pinch, and I always have mine with me, but I&rsquo;d rather be reading off something that does&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s actively _trying_ to blind me. Unlike any DRM-ed books I bought, I could just use the [tool Stanza provide][14] to download the .epub files, and drop them _right on to my reader_.

So, I am reading Cory Doctorow because he&rsquo;s a good author. But I only know that because he&rsquo;s given so much of his work away, and he has a large captive audience, admittedly of cheapskates, by embracing new formats and shucking off DRM chains. It may have only netted him a few pounds (possibly not even that, are author&rsquo;s royalties as bad as recording artists?) from the one book I&rsquo;ve actually bought, but hopefully good-will (_ahem_ whuffie), promotion and readership brings him some comfort.
