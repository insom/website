> It is desirable that a man [&hellip;] live in all respects so compactly and preparedly that, if an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the gate empty-handed without anxiety. 

&mdash; Henry Thoreau, _Walden_

> My answer is yes. A couple of years ago my wife and I moved countries. I was able to almost just leave with nothing but a small backpack<sup>1</sup>. I sold or donated all my possessions accumulated during my bachelor years and just leave with what then I considered my essential things: 42 things. _They all fit on[sic] a 65 liter<sup>2</sup> backpack._ 

&mdash; [mnmal][1]{.tumblr_blog}, Quoting the above passage from _Walden_

<sup>1</sup> I agree with the sentiment. Further:

> 6&middot; Get rid of all the stuff that doesn&rsquo;t fit in a suitcase
  
> 7&middot; Get rid of all the stuff that doesn&rsquo;t fit in a backpack
  
> 8&middot; Get rid of the backpack 

&mdash; Mark Pilgrim, _[The Pursuit of Happiness][2]_

<sup>2</sup> You don&rsquo;t often see the word &lsquo;liter&rsquo;. We had a discussion about color vs. colour vs. (my own nelogism) colr at work, but litres as such a European thing that you forget they have an American spelling too.
