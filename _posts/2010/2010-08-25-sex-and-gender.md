> We recently programmed Bucket, the IRC chat bot in #xkcd, to allow people set their gender so he can use pronouns for them. This ended up taking **hundreds of lines of code, three pages of documentation, and six different sets of pronouns and variables**, just to cover all the basic ways people in the channel with different gender identifications wanted to be referred to (even without invented pronouns like &ldquo;xe&rdquo;, which we vetoed). And that&rsquo;s just to cover the pronouns. The role of gender in society is the most complicated thing I&rsquo;ve ever spent a lot of time learning about, and I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time learning about quantum mechanics.
