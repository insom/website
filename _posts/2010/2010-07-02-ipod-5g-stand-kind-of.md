I posted this to Flickr and then thought &ldquo;I never actually post my own stuff to my blog, just other people&rsquo;s Creative Commons photos and reblogs&rdquo;. So, I&rsquo;m posting it.

I&rsquo;m quite impressed with the video capabilities of the 5G and I thought I&rsquo;d try and make a tripod-ish mount for it. This is attempt number three. Cardboard is well out; this one uses that rubber mat stuff that you use to stop things slipping off your dashboard.

As I can&rsquo;t drive, and my handle bars are too small, I use it on a table. Sometimes, I use it on my iPod. Some kind of double pitchfork design might work better and I&rsquo;ll be less scared of crushing it or scratching the glass.
