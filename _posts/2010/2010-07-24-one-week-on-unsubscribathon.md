![Look at those small numbers!][1]

Wow. My one-week experiment to pay better attention to things could scarcely have worked better.

I have unsubscribed from nearly all of my RSS feeds (I now follow 14 feeds, down from about 60, some of which were _high traffic_). I spend a lot less time leaning on the &ldquo;k&rdquo; key to scan through and process anything I may want to see. (You know Reader [supports vi-style keys][2], right?). Justifications for removal include:

  * I was once interested in this niche subject, but now I realise I have a full life with no room for it. (Z80 microcomputers, [Creating Digital Music][3] (ahem)).
  * This website is a continuous fount of stuff, I will never reach the end, and if I stopped watching it for a few days/weeks/month, I would not have missed anything (Any LOLcat style feed, [Lifehacker][4]). If I need a fix, I can visit the site.
  * This is a feed which has a vanishingly small amount of articles which I care about, which I could search for if I needed an answer (Lifehacker and its &ldquo;Hive Fives&rdquo; fit in this category).
  * This feed contains content which I regularly get links to the best bits of by other avenues, like Twitter, friends emailing me, or links from other popular sites in the same vein. ([Hack-a-Day][5] fits into this, though out of sentimentality, I have kept HAD, as well as [MAKE][6]).

With the exception of a few comics which I don&rsquo;t want to miss any episodes of ([Penny Arcade][7], [XKCD][8]), what is left is:

  * People I know personally, whom I want to take the time to read as their opinions are worth more than an anonymous Internet person. ([Knittage][9], [Stryker][10], [The White Room][11]).
  * People who consistently post sensible length, well thought out or engaging articles. ([Paul Robert Lloyd][12], [Mark Pilgrim][13], [Buster Benson][14], [Patrick Ng][15]).

The same goes for Tumblr, though I do follow a few more &ldquo;fount of stuff&rdquo; type people on there, the design of the dashboard (it just scrolls buy, instead of amounting to a big &ldquo;unread&rdquo; count in Reader) means that I can quickly ignore things I&rsquo;m not interested in as part of my daily processing. If I find I&rsquo;m ignoring a particular person a lot, I unfollow them. I&rsquo;ve reduced my following count on Tumblr by half, with no feeling of loss. I am not following &ldquo;fuckyeah-&rdquo; anything.

Twitter has a similar but expanded set of rules: I also unfollow people who appear to completely disregard the medium. If you just use Twitter to push updates to your site or blog, that&rsquo;s not interesting. If you block post 5-6 tweets in a row, you&rsquo;re a candidate. If you can&rsquo;t fit your thoughts in 140 characters: start a blog. I&rsquo;ve reduced the people I&rsquo;m following on Twitter by about two thirds.

The results? As I alluded to above: fantastic.

When I&rsquo;m away from my computer, especially at peek social-network-update time: 5PM GMT, I don&rsquo;t get daunted by a high unread count on any sites. When I&rsquo;m reading a post written by or pointed to by one of the people left I don&rsquo;t feel the compulsion to &ldquo;check in&rdquo; on social networking like I used to. I think I previously, subconsciously, didn&rsquo;t want to fall behind.

Completest that I am, falling behind means reading every single fucking thing until I am bang up-to-date.

I read better stuff. I send anything longer than about a two screen-fulls to Instapaper. I then read this on eReader/iPad/iPhone &#8211; away from the distractions of my computer. When I&rsquo;m at my computer, I&rsquo;m less distracted by social networking. Computer for work. Mobile device for play.

None of this is brain surgery, except&hellip; it is. It&rsquo;s my attempt to reverse the rewiring that [I wrote about before][16]. So far, so good.
