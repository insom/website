Door etiquette. Fuck that.

Hold it open for the next person, or the whole group you&rsquo;re with? And isn&rsquo;t it weird when a bunch of strangers then go through? How about when your group rushes past another group politely waiting for you (even though they got to the door first!).

Do you push a two-way door through and hold from the other side? What if you see someone coming toward the door from the other side- do you open it for them, or will they think you&rsquo;ve not noticed them, and then stand aside for you, inverting your gesture- making them the polite ones, and you the boor.
