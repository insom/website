It&rsquo;s Saturday morning, and I finally finished my Instapaper eReader export from last week:

_[CMMI For Dummies][1]_

A really good introduction into what the Capability Maturity Model Integrated is all about, and how to take a company from level 1 (effectively chaos) to through the levels of documenting process, then following, measuring and finally improving.

_[Shareable Futures][2]_ and _[The Jammie Dodgers and the Adventure of the Leicester Square Screening][3]_

The announcement of a new series of positive futurism; it&rsquo;s a pleasant return to 1960&rsquo;s science fiction where we thought that the future would actually be better than today, not some Orwellian nightmare (though, there&rsquo;s a definite oppressive government force in Doctorow&rsquo;s story). Once again, Cory Doctorow has his agenda and sticks to it, no real surprise, but it&rsquo;s written into a short, simple and fun story.

_[To Die of Having Lived][4]_

An article in the American Scholar with advice from a surgeon on how people should approach their deaths and those of their loved ones; of how once you enter the modern save-life-at-all-costs-and-don&rsquo;t-get-sued medical system it&rsquo;s very hard for a patient or the family to get their wishes taken notice of. Very good.

_[Can you Disappear in Surveillance Britain?][5]_

A Times article outlining David Bond&rsquo;s minor mental freak-out, attempts to disappear and avoid capture, and how he captured it all for the More4 documentary &ldquo;[Erasing David][6]&rdquo; (which I have on PVR, but have not watched yet).
