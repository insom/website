You know that thing where you spend ages making a point about a thing, and then you find a much better written and clear version of that same viewpoint?

Well, if you enjoyed my rambling and inarticulate article about [multifaceted identity][1] then you will probably enjoy [The Real Real Problem with Facebook][2] by [Nishant Kothary][3] even more.

[ And if you care about this stuff already then you&rsquo;ll be thrilled to see that [Mark Zuckerberg has backtracked on his opinions about identity][4], something thoughtfully picked upon on [moot&rsquo;s blog][5] ]
