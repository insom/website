![Graph those Doge][1]

Just a quick update on how Dogecoin continues to dominate my life.

I&rsquo;ve gone a bit off track; it used to be about the lols, but now that it has a substantial value (I sold some for 240 Satoshis<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>!) I&rsquo;m mining it with my co-workers so we can buy a video card for a gaming machine we&rsquo;ve commandeered at work.

(The 20,000&#393; I spent on this wonderful portrait was worth nearly &pound;30 at one point)<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"

We _were_ mining Litecoins, just before they dipped in price and the pool that we were using got hacked.

[Coinwars][5] showed that Doge was the most profitable so we switched to [DogePool.pw][6] &#8211; &hellip; and then it then got hacked.

We switched to [Lucky Miners][7] and then it had an outage. Back to DogePool! DDoS against DogePool. Back to Lucky Miners! Estimated 1 Doge pay out after 24 hours of mining. Tried to cash out the 0.3 LTC we&rsquo;d mined in the previous week: transactions were frozen for three days. Got the LTC into my Cryptsy account: LTC bottoms out. Convert the LTC to BTC: [Bitcoin takes a dive as US arrests are made related to money laundering][8].

You can see how you might get despondent.

So: we&rsquo;re running our own pool. Kind-of. I&rsquo;m running a [P2Pool][9] instance locally and it uses some super-clever crypto to make sure that everyone gets paid fairly- you add blocks to the share-chain and then when blocks are solved you&rsquo;re making yourself eligible for a pay out.

If you&rsquo;re looking for a middle-of-the-UK P2Pool that&rsquo;s not busy, you could do worse than [home.insom.me.uk][10]

Exciting times ahead.
