As someone who&#8217;s written about [digital share cropping][1] before, I&#8217;m actually really hopeful about [WordPress.com][2]&#8216;s [Jetpack][3] plugin.

_[ I&#8217;ve decided to give WordPress a spin because, after years of shying away from it for security reasons, I&#8217;ve realised that it probably does a lot more good than bad for the health of the web. Also, like Magento, it seems probable that much of its negative rep comes from middling-quality third party plug-ins, and not the core experience. ]_

In a way, WordPress has always lead the way, with [Automattic][4] services like [Gravatar][5] and [Akismet][6] &#8211; providing centralisation where it makes sense, but making those strengths available to millions of distributed blogs.

[Jetpack][3] takes this even further, integrating the fairly slick statistics, notifications and monitoring that [WordPress.com][2] blogs have (and that require non-trivial server-side components to work) into a blog you can run anywhere. You can hug your data. It&#8217;s right there, on your server, but you also get these nice third party things.

It&#8217;s actually really slick, moving you between [WordPress.com][2] and your own blog fairly seamlessly, and making [good use of OAuth flows][7] to keep things secure while it does.

And if [Automattic][4] pull the plug tomorrow, or go on an [incredible journey][8] &#8211; well, you&#8217;ll lose some extra fancy parts of your install, but basically your WordPress site will be intact. [Archive Team][9] will not need to [rescue your shit][10].
