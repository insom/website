Hating notifications is all the rage, I&rsquo;ve done it myself: I huff at people who break off mid-conversation to see who&rsquo;s retweeted them; my wife&rsquo;s phone _and_ tablet sound loudly if someone on the Internet says her name. (Possibly in front of a mirror? I&rsquo;m not sure how this works)

I&rsquo;ve been swayed by the [Minimal iPhone][1] blog posts and I&rsquo;ve written and spoken about removing distractions, [unfollowing people and streams that don&rsquo;t make you happy][2] and deleting applications that [start to feel like addictions][3].

But I&rsquo;ve recently noticed an unproductive habit: checking and rechecking web sites and applications. You could label it [fear of missing out][4], and it is, but it&rsquo;s also because for my job I have a mixture of job roles that can be broadly defined as two things:

  * Getting lost in deep thought: Dig into errant programs in GDB. Hold the context of IOS routers and network diagrams in my head. Trace tricky race conditions and untangle failing tests. Write and copy-edit various documentation, blog posts and marketing material. 
  * Reacting immediately: Answering support calls from customers. Dealing with a site outage or a failed router. Restoring something from a backup _now_. Unscheduled meetings. Failures of planning on other people&rsquo;s parts. 

I really want to like the first type of work, it&rsquo;s the most fulfilling in the long term, but like most people, I find it really easy to fall into the trap of doing lots of the second kind of work. I feel the dopamine kick of getting something done, even if the thing was as trivial as a DNS update a customer asked for in a ticket.

More responsibly, I don&rsquo;t want to be the guy who dives deep into his own work and ignores the support calls, tickets and fires that spring up. We don&rsquo;t have a top-down structure- everyone grabs their own fair share of the support burden, so if I don&rsquo;t pay attention then other people have to pick up my slack. That&rsquo;s not fair.

* * *

In an effort to get more of the first type of work done, I turned off lots of notifications. I didn&rsquo;t run a Twitter client in the background, have pop-ups from email, receive alerts from the ticket system, or have my IM client flash to get my attention.

I worked in a full screen terminal or text editor, Getting Stuff Done.

Nirvana. Perfect. Exactly how &ldquo;distraction free&rdquo; working is supposed to work.

Except that, with no status notifications, I couldn&rsquo;t resist Cmd-Tabbing every few minutes to see if I&rsquo;d missed a conversation in our group chat, or an important ticket update or an email from a big customer. ([Our alerting dashboard][5] is on my desk, and has sound, so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about missing _that_)

The less progress I was making on the big thing, the more frequently I distracted myself by polling.

* * *

This week&rsquo;s self-experiment has been to turn notifications back on- the right ones, at least.

I wear a watch so that I don&rsquo;t lose track of time in a full-screen window, but so that I don&rsquo;t switch apps just to see the clock on my computer.

Adium notifies me of every conversation with a pop up. I can glance and decide not to take action but, as long as I&rsquo;m at my desk, it&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to miss what&rsquo;s going on.

The team I&rsquo;m in have tweaked our alerting further: it goes off less and when it does, it&rsquo;s usually serious. Alerting fatigue had crept back in to the system without us really noticing it. [Considering that I gave a talk on this subject][6] I feel bad for not acting sooner.

The important part of turning notifications on again is that **if nothing is popping up then nothing is happening, and I don&rsquo;t have a reason to pull myself away from my work to check on it**.

It&rsquo;s going well, even though it&rsquo;s just been a few days. The pendulum will probably swing back and I&rsquo;ll have to dial down the notifications at some point, but some of that can be dealt with by caring about fewer things.

It may be that I&rsquo;m aware of _too_ much, and it takes an excess of notifications to make me realise.
