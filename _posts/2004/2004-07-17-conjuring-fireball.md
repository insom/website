*Pictured*: Me, channeling energy into a dangerous fireball with
which to lay waste to my foes.

That said, as much as this ability would shift the balance of power in
contract negotiations, I can't actually do this, _yet_.

This effect was achieved through old-school camera trickery of the film
variety. It's customary for photographers to list their equipment with a
photograph, and it usually consists of something impressive like "Canon EOS
300 with 50:1.8 Prime Lens on Fuji Velvia ASA100".

Being that I cannot afford, and would not likely use, such expensive
equipment, this is my list of items used:

* One Polaroid One Fun Pack Camera
* One sheet of Polaroid 600 film, reduced to half price because our local Dixons is closing
* One strip of developed blank negative film, taped over the flash; unknown brand from cheap disposable camera
* One roll of tin-foil, taped shiny-side-in to the sides and above the camera
* Four pieces of card, cut from one business card with a typo on it, stuck to form a square around the lens around 1cm&sup2;
* One roll of what everyone calls sellotape, but isn't
* One luminous yellow hilighter pen, used to colour in a piece of sellotape placed in the 1cm&sup2; square left over the lens

I would advise everyone to get a Polaroid camera. You can get an i-Zone one in
Toys'R'Us for under &pound;10. I got my Polaroid 1200 for &pound;9, but
the film cartridges are like hen's teeth to find. Expect to pay around
&pound;1 per picture, making it a slightly expensive hobby.

It gives you instant gratification and, more importantly, it might save your
soul from digital.
