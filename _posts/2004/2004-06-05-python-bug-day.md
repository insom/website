The first [Python Bug Day][pbd] is drawing to a close, now that CVS on SourceForge has apparently died.

Personally, I enjoyed the whole thing, and it gave me an excuse to poke around in the internals of Python (which has some of the cleanest C I've seen in a body of code its size).

The final tally of bugs is available at the [status page][pbds].
