Have you even found blogging to be too much effort; to be as much work
as, well, work is? Has the enormous gap in the archives, where you
haven't posted, irritated you every time you go to your own site?

I have. So, I removed my own DNS records.

I could hear the sombre voice of my website; singing Daisy to me, one
final time. I was free, to read a book in the evening without guilt, not
caring about the few hundred inbound broken links, the timing out RSS
readers; the pressure to produce removed.

God, I missed my blog.

So, here I am again, new and improved, with a clean sheet, and no
guarantees.

Bloggers seem to make nooses for their own necks- we thrive on
permalinks, frequent updates and availability over RSS. But, as I
commented on in a blog entry that you can't read anymore, maintaining
all of those links is a nightmare.

If you want to use new blog software, you *have* to make sure all
of your old links still work. If you want to maintain readers, you
*need* to post early, post often. If you want syndication, you
have *got* to support RSS 1.0, 2.0 and Atom.

Actually, no, you don't. I'm sorry, but my happiness is not dependant on
angle brackets and Google juice. Bloggers, cast off your chains!

Throw a blog tantrum.
