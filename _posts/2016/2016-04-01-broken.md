Well, that went a bit badly didn't it?

Two pretty disrupted evenings (for personal reasons) and I've let my writing
streak and French (Duolingo) streak slip. I got a [contribution][c] in
yesterday at least! But I didn't write about it. And I haven't moved on my PR.
And, I've got to be honest; I'm not going to do it tonight, either.
