This is my first journal entry! I had to add support for a new `type` to my
blog to create it, so, I'd better make good use it.

I'm attempting to create a GitHub streak and otherwise tap into a burst of
creativity and 'making' that I've had lately. I'm going to try and contribute
one thing to the commons every day, with no defined end date.

Today, I've created this [pull request][pr] against Ansible to make templates
work the same way when they are used as a `lookup` as when they are used as an
`action`. It's a small step, but it made me notice that my Ansible fork was
13000+ commits behind. There's 18000~ commits in the project, so actually I
got in right at the start with my earlier contributions.

It's not just GitHub: I've had a run of projects these last few weeks and
months: my Z80 computer, little microcontroller hacks, bits and pieces of Ruby
and C, noodlings in JavaScript, 3D designs I've come up with. If I can publish
one thing a day in an appropriate place, or on here, I'll consider my streak
to be on going.

Wish me luck.
