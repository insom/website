It's my first Thanksgiving in Canada, so I took the opportunity (and extra day
off of work) to clear out the wood-room in the basement.

My landlord had left woodworking tools behind when they moved across country,
but the room had enough spiders, webs and saw-dust that I .. uh .. hadn't
gotten around to using them yet.

I saw a cheap frame for a desk in IKEA's Seconds section but they had no table
tops. I was sure I could get one, so I picked it up any way. When I found a
stack of old fencing in the garage, I was sure it would do. It was in pretty
bad condition, but basically straight and flat:

Some industrial extension cord, lights and a lot of vacuuming and sweeping
later, and I was ready to chop it down:

Then a go with the orbital sander:

Because I've not even really been to a hardware store yet, I only had one sheet
of sandpaper, thankfully it was enough. The dry fit turned out well; a few
pieces needed some sanding on their ends for ease, but I standed them all to
avoid future splinters.

It's not *perfectly* flat, but for basically free wood and basically free tools
on a free day, I'm really pleased.
