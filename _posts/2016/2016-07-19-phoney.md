For work today I took a long-standing card to hook up our internal Asterisk
phone system with some form of Caller ID database. You can [make Asterisk use
MySQL][my] or fork a Python process [using AGI][agi], but I didn't want any
of this to be "in-band".

In the past I've used simple Flask services to provide simplified JSON APIs so
I can encapsulate logic in a language that I prefer, and not the scripting or
configuration language I'm stuck using (like collectd's or Asterisk's).

[The result is up on iWeb's GitHub][g]

The software will receive a POST from Asterisk with the source and destination
number, and that POST is expected to return a name to display on the Caller ID
as the only body. It also has a very simple Bootstrap GUI for updating the
numbers, which shows incoming calls to the office, newest first:

![Calls](https://insm.cf/_/d316606a5e72.png)

The little bit of Asterisk scripting required is just this:

    exten => _X.,1,Set(CALLERID(name)=${CURL("http://127.0.0.1:5000/numbers/c/${EXTEN}",from=${CALLERID(num)})})

That part after the last comma is verbatim posted as the contents of the
request, the `from=` is required to make it kind-of URL encoded.

None of this really stands up to security scrutiny on the WAN, so it's all best
kept on internal networks, but for a small network or a house, it should work
pretty well.
