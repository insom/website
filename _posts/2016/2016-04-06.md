Look at those gaps!

![An Imperfect Record](https://insom.iweb-storage.com/public/files/635b759d.png?inline=1)

I think that chasing green squares has become too cynical for me&mdash; it's
caused me to neglect a larger PR (on Cachet) because starting fresh, smaller,
changes is likely to generate a better looking picture.

I literally considered delaying [one][] of my two [two][] pull requests
yesterday so that I could drag them out to a streak. That's no way to be.

[one]: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1971
[two]: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1974

I'm *glad* I've broken my streak, now I can concentrate on doing better work,
not just more work.
