title: "Basic Z80 Microcomputer"

---

I've wanted a little Z80 microcomputer of my own for ages. I never learned to
get the most out of a Z80 when it was appropriate (like, when I had a Spectrum
+2) and it seemed simple enough to build on my own. There's a smattering of
other Z80 self-builds on the Internet and [a fantastic free book about the
process][book].

I chose the Z80 because:

* It's close to the 8086 instruction set, which I've been exposed to
  on-and-off for years.
* It's still available for purchase.
* It can be clocked very slowly[^1], so I can use blinking lights and the
  electronics group's 10Mhz scope for debugging if I need to.
* IO is not memory mapped. There's effectively a separate bus for memory and
  IO operations.
* There's a tiny pipe dream that I could get CP/M up and running one day.
* I had some experience with the [C language toolchain for it][st].

[^1]: That said, modern 6502's can apparently be clocked down to DC due to a fully static design. Good for them! My Z80 runs at 125Khz - that's been slow enough so far.

Not Even Hello World
--------------------

I ordered a Z80 (6MHz DIP40 version, though it's never going that fast &mdash;
Z84C0006PEG) and a 1MHz oscillator (not just a crystal!). I had 8K of flash
ROM and 64K of static RAM left over from an earlier project. I got a set of
three breadboards to build everything on, an Arduino Mega clone to program it,
a little breadboard PSU and a PIO (because it was cheap).

The first step was to get a 'free running' circuit working. [I followed what
Stian Soreng did][ss] and pulled the data and address busses down to ground,
and NMI/INT/HALT/WAIT and RESET up to 5V. I put an LED (uh, segment) on A11 so
that I could see the light flash around every 2048 instructions.

Slowly Slowly
-------------

I ended up using a 7493 to divide the clock by 8 so I could slow things down
and monitor things with LEDs. This means my Z80 is running at 125KHz.

I'm thrilled to say that this worked first time: I'd never used this part and
the part itself was highly suspect, but you can see the original and the
divided signal on the A and B channels of our oscilloscope:

Learning to Count
-----------------

Blinking a light is the Hello World of hardware, but I'd gotten a logic
analyser for Christmas (specifically for this project, really). It has 8
inputs, which is more limiting than I originally expected, so I hooked up the
lower seven pins to the address bus and a pin to /RD, with a trigger set.

It looks beautiful at this point:

![Analyser Hookups](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1494/25760685190_e9645e76a6_b.jpg)

But at least you can see it counting! I'm going to consider this as a program
which is all `NOP` instructions is just another way for saying "incrementing
`PC`".

![Analyser Output](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1589/25967148391_88909c7635_b.jpg)

Programming
-----------

Well, now that we can definitely execute `NOP`s, it would be great to execute
even a small program. It turns out that this simple step requires a pretty
considerable amount of work. There's a hint in the last update's pictures,
where you can see my Arduino Mega (clone) in the background.

The idea was always to get the Arduino to poke some data into the RAM and then
start the processor. In the early stages that can mean I avoid programming
flash ROMs, which is a whole extra level of messing around I'd love to
short circuit. This adds many wires.

![My board so far](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/25760675350_f5b98925dd_b.jpg)

I'm breaking with chronology here: I wrote the RAM programmer before the Z80's
arrived, so I could be reasonably sure that this approach would work. The
earliest version just wrote a values to matching RAM locations and read it back
out again - [you can see that here][here].

[here]: https://github.com/insom/LittleComputer/blob/2b00e1a87da0f8c7fce4a137b793cf224114e7dc/Arduino/ram-excercise.ino

The [better version][bv] actually responds to commands:

* (d)ump the contents of the bottom 256 bytes of RAM
* (z)ero the RAM, for sanity
* (l)oad the preconfigured program, stored in the microcontroller
* p(o)ke one memory location

I'll deal with poke in a later update, but this program, and the example
program encoded in `ram[]` lets me zero the RAM, load in the program, bring
the `RESET` line high on the processor, wait a second, bring `RESET` low, and
dump the RAM out.

Here's the RAM after a triumphant run:

    0x00 00 FF D3 55 D3 55 18 F8  55 14 7A D6 C8 38 F3 18
    0x10 EF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

That's the program itself.

    0x20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    0x30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    0x40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    0x50 00 00 00 00 00 B1 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

There's some data I wrote to IO 0x55. A little hiccup: because I haven't done
any address decoding on this board yet, `OUT` instructions actually write RAM.

    0x60 00 00 00 00 64 65 66 67  68 69 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E 6F
    0x70 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77  78 79 7A 7B 7C 7D 7E 7F
    0x80 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87  88 89 8A 8B 8C 8D 8E 8F
    0x90 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97  98 99 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F
    0xA0 A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7  A8 A9 AA AB AC AD AE AF
    0xB0 B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7  B8 B9 BA BB BC BD BE BF
    0xC0 C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

And here's a simple "write A to the memory location A" style effect: 0x64
contains an 0x64 and so on.

The program was written in C, here's the [full listing][fl]. I'll switch to
assembly for the next few programs, because it's easier for me to verify my
programs and learn about the different addressing modes that the processor
supports in assembly.

Assembly
--------

The equivalent to the above C program is [this short commented Assembly
listing][sh]. My first draft of address decoding hadn't worked, so I wanted to
go back and check that even the `/IO` pin was being toggled in the way that I
expected.

I'd already found that hooking up my logic analyser was leading to weird
results, so I opted to try my little single-channel kit oscilloscope:

![Pulses](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/26033429865_89016b98b6_b.jpg)

So, 0.5ms apart when running at 125Khz, about 60 clock cycles per IO.

This [listing with two IOs, one after another][l2] should show me how fast I
can toggle the line, without any extra accesses or comparisons:

![More Pulses](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1448/25430914683_017dd00bfb_b.jpg)

About 12 clock cycles per IO, or 10Khz.

Address Decoding
----------------

It's clearly not great to have IO operations also twiddle bits of RAM.

About the simplest decoding I can do is to join the `/CE` pin of the RAM to
the `/MREQ` line of the processor, but even with this done I wasn't getting
the results I expected.

Most of this [was a software fix][fix]. I've changed the `/OE`, `/WE` and
`/CE` lines to use the internal pull-up resistors (so I've removed the 1K's I
put on the breadboard) and most importantly I'm de-asserting `/CE` with every
call to `disownBus` - holding it low the whole time was the source of my
problems.

Now that is done,

    0x50 00 00 00 00 00 A1 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

has become the much better

    0x50 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

after the program has executed.

Actual IO
---------

<a name="actual"></a>
To do anything remotely useful with this computer I'm going to need some IO. A
UART would be ideal, but first things first, just some LEDs I can control from
the Z80 would do.

I'm going to skip past the abortive attempts that didn't work, using a 7475
Quad Latch. What I *do* have working is a circuit with a 7404 and a 74HC374
Octal Flip-Flop. I'm going to refer to this as a 'register' - that may not be
100% correct, but you can only type flip-flop so many times before it becomes
silly.

I'm cheating with my address decoding again: as this is the only IO on the
breadboard, I'm not actually decoding the address lines at all, I'm just
triggering the register based on the `/IO` signal. I don't even decode `/WR` or
`/RD` - so either IO operation would store the contents of the data bus.

The data lines are hooked directly up to the D lines on the register. The clock
signal for the 74HC374 is positive-edge triggered, but the `/IO` line is
negative-edge triggered, so I pipe the `/IO` signal into one of the inverters
in a 7404.

Sidebar: I wasted a lot of time before finding out that one of the inverters in
the 7404 is broken. Test your assumptions!

![PulseView](/img/z80/logic.png)

I hooked up the logic analyser to `D0`, `D1`, the divided down system clock,
`/IO` and the `IO` output from the 7404. The `/IO` is labelled as `IO` in the
picture, and the `IO` signal as `_IO`. Sorry!

This is a successful capture of part of my [new blinking lights program][p]
executing. You can see `_IO` rise periodically - when it does, the contents of
`D0` and `D1` are copied to the `Q0` and `Q1` pins of the 74HC374. These are
connected via LEDs to a resistor and then ground.

![Board](https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27662083866_f452e1984f_b.jpg)

This is the current state of the IO section of the board. The 7404 is up top,
next to the unconnected 7475, with the 74HC374 in the middle. The LEDs are
clearly visible, and the rainbow wires leading off to the logic analyser.

I'm going to need some more gates to do sensible decoding, but this is
basically enough to do bit-banged SPI. Milestone!
