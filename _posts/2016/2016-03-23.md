Between Laravel attempts, I've nailed my green square for today with [this pull
request][pr] which is linked to [this JIRA ticket][jira].

At work we had to upgrade from CloudStack 4.5 to at least 4.6 to start running
some code that *we wrote* which wasn't in the release we were running. In order
to get back on a supported version, we had to build *another* unsupported one
by fixing the timeouts for virtual router creation. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
