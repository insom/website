Monday was a good day for post!

I've joined the iPhone club. I've already twittered about this, and it's not
like no one's seen an iPhone before, but I will say I didn't expect to be as
impressed as I am. I am not a phone person, but I'm impressed. If I could have an
A4 version to replace my laptop, that would suit fine.

I had to photograph this because of how coolly it was packed. It's just a SATA
to USB adaptor (oh, and a PSU), but it looks so ... well travelled. That's bound
with knots, not elastic bands, by the way.

And I haven't actually opened this one, but Bricky should help me build some
raised beds. I have done some basic bricklaying before (repair, more than
anything) and technically I have a Construction Studies qualification, but I
think I'll be watching the instructional DVD before I do anything.
