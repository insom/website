Hi, I'm Aaron.

I'm an Irish software developer living in Ottawa, Canada, where I work as a Staff Production Engineer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>.

<a href="https://twitter.com/insom">I have Twitter</a>, but it's really just for self-promotion these days.

I am the admin of a Mastodon instance which is an off-shoot of the <a href="https://tilde.town">tilde.town intentional digital community</a>. <a href="https://tiny.tilde.website/@insom">My <strike>views</strike> takes are my own</a>.

I contribute sporadically to software on <a href="https://github.com/insom">GitHub</a>, upload photos to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/insomnike">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronwbrady">reject recruiter spam on LinkedIn</a>.
